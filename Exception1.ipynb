    "# An exception in Python is an incident that happens while executing a program that causes the regular course of the program's commands to be disrupted. When a Python code comes across a condition it can't handle, it raises an exception. An object in Python that describes an error is called an exception.\n",
    "# Syntax error refers to an error in the syntax or structure of the code, meaning that the code is not written according to the rules of the programming language. These errors are usually caught by the compiler or interpreter before the code is executed, and they prevent the code from being compiled or run on the otherhand , an exception refers to an error that occurs during the execution of a program. These errors are not caught by the compiler or interpreter and can cause the program to terminate or behave unexpectedly. Exceptions can occur due to a variety of reasons, such as division by zero, trying to access an array element that does not exist, or attempting to open a file that does not exist."
